## Open Source Landmarking Library

Detailed description will be added soon

## Dependencies

### libclandmark

 - CImg (>= 1.5.6)
 - RapidXML (1.13)

If any of these libraries are installed in a known system prefix, CLandmark will try to use the already installed version.
Otherwise, the internal version will be used and its files will be installed alongside CLandmark.

**CAVEAT**: The version of RapidXML that comes with CLandmark has been changed to fix some missing forward declarations.
